# TDD Implementation

I'll implement **$ARGUMENTS** using Test-Driven Development (TDD). We'll follow these steps:

1. **Analyze requirements** for $ARGUMENTS
2. **Write failing tests** (RED)
3. **Implement minimum code** to pass tests (GREEN)
4. **Refactor** while keeping tests passing (REFACTOR)

## TDD Process

### 1. Test Plan

- What should $ARGUMENTS do?
- What are the edge cases?
- What errors should we handle?

### 2. Write Tests First

- Start with simplest test case
- Tests must fail initially
- Progress to complex scenarios
- Include error cases

### 3. Minimal Implementation

- Only code needed to pass current test
- No extra features
- Keep files under 300 lines

### 4. Refactor

- Improve code quality
- Remove duplication
- Maintain passing tests

## Testing Stages

1. **Unit tests** - Isolated components
2. **Integration tests** - Component interactions
3. **E2E tests** - Full user journeys

## Remember

- Tests before implementation
- One test at a time
- Simplest solution first
- Refactor with confidence

Let's start by understanding what we're building and creating a test plan.
